# Practicing NestJS - Dog Shelter
This is a very simple NesttJS backend I use to learn the basics of the framework.

## What the user can do
1. login
2. list dogs
3. add dogs
4. delete dogs
5. edit dogs

## Techniques used
1. global validation pipes
2. local auth to log in
3. jwt auth to protect some routes
4. separate modules for features/entities
5. faker.js
6. class-validator

## TODO
1. DB and ORM (TypeORM)
2. CRUD for users
3. role based authorization
4. more exhaustive validation
5. use more advanced techniques e.g. interceptors
